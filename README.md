Welcome to my project portfolio! Here are some projects I've worked on, both individually and in collaboration with others:

## Projects

- [Music Genre Classification using Machine Learning and Neural Networks](https://github.com/NarmeenAlmarzooqi/music-genre-classification)
  An automated system leveraging advanced audio feature extraction techniques (MFCCs, Mel Spectrograms) and models like Random Forest, SVM, MLP, CNN, and LSTM to classify music tracks into genres. Achieved 81% accuracy with the MLP model, showcasing potential for applications in music recommendation systems and streaming platforms.
